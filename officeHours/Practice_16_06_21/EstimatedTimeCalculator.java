/*
Assume that you have a plan to go from A to B point
   							maxSpeed=80
   							minSpeed=40

   							- Ask the User
   								- Car speed
   											should be 40 - 80 mph
   										-> if user enters smaller than minSpeed
   																or
   													 	   bigger than maxSpeed
   										-   assign for speed 60 as default
   										-   otherwise assign for speed userInput(int)

   								- startingpoint(string) and destination(string)
   								- distance between this two points(double)

   								According to this information calculate triptime;

   								Formula of estimatedTime = distance/speed;

   							   	Ex :

   										Inputs :50,San Antonio,Dallas,300

   										"The Estimated Time Of Arrival is 6.0 hours from San Antonio to Dallas "
